# ðŸš€ About

Hi, I'm Yordan Yordanov, training to be a full-stack developer with focus on web development.

On the front-end side, I am currently learning **Angular**.

Moving to the back end, Iâ€™m building apps on **Node.js**.

I also train to have extensive experience working with databases such as **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, in order to design efficient database structures and write optimized queries.

*This node.js resume builder should generate a resume illustrating my experience, education, and skills.*

## How To Run

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Generate the resume

```bash
  npm run start
```
